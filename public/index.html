<!--    Choosing type-->
<!--    When you have some text, how can you choose a typeface? Many people—professional designers included—go through an app’s font menu until we find one we like. But the aim of this module is to show that there are many considerations that can improve our type choices. By setting some useful constraints to aid our type selection, we can also develop a critical eye for analyzing type along the way.-->


<!--    A checklist for choosing type-->


<!--    Emotive considerations for choosing typefaces-->


<!--    Choosing reliable typefaces-->


<!--    Exploring typefaces with multiple weights or grades-->


<!--    Exploring width in type-->


<!--    Choosing typefaces that have optical sizes-->


<!--    Pairing typefaces-->


<!--    Pairing typefaces within a family & superfamily-->


<!--    Pairing typefaces by the same type designer or type foundry-->


<!--    Pairing typefaces using the font matrix-->


<!--    Exploring x-height & the em square-->


<!--    Adding fonts to Google Docs and Slides-->

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
